 * <i> Dormice are rodents of the family Gliridae. (This family is also variously called Myoxidae or Muscardinidae by
 * different taxonomists). Dormice are mostly found in Europe, although some live in Africa and Asia. <b>They are
 * particularly known for their long periods of hibernation.</b> Because only one species of dormouse is native to the
 * British Isles, in everyday English usage "dormouse" usually refers to this species (the Hazel Dormouse) rather than
 * to the family as a whole.<br/>
 * (from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormouse">Wikipedia</a>) </i>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class does nothing else then sleeping the whole time. And doing so, believe it or not, it stabilizes the system
 * clock on Windows systems, while interrupt time is held down on 1ms during its sleep, making calls to
 * <code>Thread.sleep(milli < 15ms)</code> possible/reasonable (and simulation stable, fluid and smooth!=) ).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * I know, sounds a bit esoteric at first, but comes very handy while it's just working!!! Found <a
