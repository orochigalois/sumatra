This is the central AI software of Tigers Mannheim called Sumatra.
In order to build and run it, it is recommended to use Eclipse. 
However, it "should" also be possible to build it with Maven.

System Requirements
 * Java JDK 8
 * Maven
 * Internet connection
 * no limitations on OS known

Build:
import all projects to eclipse
or
run "mvn install" from command line

Run:
Running Sumatra with Eclipse is as easy as importing it to your workspace and simply press Run.
It should automatically use the shared launch config. 
The main class containing the main-method is called "Sumatra.java".
You can find it using Ctrl+Shift+T.

You can also use the run.sh script to run without eclipse

For more detailed information about compiling and running Sumatra, have a look at our AutoReferee implementation which is based on Sumatra:
http://gitlab.tigers-mannheim.de/open-source/AutoReferee

There is an internal simulator that can be used without any external dependencies.
We also provide a modified version of grSim (original: https://github.com/mani-monaj/grSim).
It can be found on our homepage.
You should be able to run AI against AI within one Sumatra instance. After hitting the run button, you can use the original refbox or the ref view in Sumatra to start a game.
Make sure you configure "moduli_grSim" or "moduli_sumatra" in the menu bar for simulation. This can be done in the config view under "user".
There are additional moduli configs for example to use shared radio. 
Most configs can be found in the cfg view.
